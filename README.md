Everyone loves pizza! 

This project was to design a mock restaurant with shell scripting. The main features were providing menu options using the "select" command, indexed arrays (I found they worked better for what I needed than using associative arrays), and building shopping cart functionality, including keeping track of order items and prices and returning them as a summary at check-out. 

(Included are several iterations of test files I used as I worked through the challenge. Some of these are not complete and meant to keep separate from the main files.)
